# 🦷 CAD_CAM – 3D Tooth Visualization

**English** | [Deutsch](README.de.md)

Browser-based tool for **visualizing and measuring 3D tooth models** (STL/PLY).
The application runs directly in the browser via GitHub Pages — no installation required.

**Live application:** https://digitaleaesthetischezahnmedizin.github.io/CAD_CAM/

## Purpose

The program provides **objective visualization and measurement** of changes to teeth based on
digital 3D scans from different treatment phases (e.g. before and after a preparation, as well as
with restorations in place).

It is used in the context of an **independent procedure for the taking of evidence**
("selbständiges Beweisverfahren", §§ 485 et seq. of the German Code of Civil Procedure, ZPO)
concerning an **alleged / disputed** veneer treatment fault at a dentist in Heilbronn, Germany. One of the
disputed points is whether the restorations are to be classified as veneers or as partial crowns.
The application serves solely to illustrate the technical aspects of the matter in dispute.

## Features

- **Load models** – STL/PLY via web link or local file; optional texture (JPG) for PLY models.
- **Display settings** – scale, FOV, background color, grid, camera position (X/Y/Z).
- **Deviation heatmap** – signed color scale (±4 mm) comparing a reference and a target model.
- **Tolerance bands** – adjustable green range, yellow/red and light-blue/dark-blue ranges, maximum threshold.
- **Mouse measurement (pins)** – point-to-surface distances with adjustable point size.
- **Iterative high-precision measurement** ("Sun/Fan") – rays per step, iterations, line-of-sight check to skip gaps.
- **2D cross-section measurement** – clipping plane for precise edge measurement.
- Multilingual interface and light/dark mode.

## Quick guide: performing a measurement

The following steps are required to perform a distance measurement between two models:

1. Open the web page.
2. Wait until all models have loaded (status at the bottom of the sidebar).
3. In the "Loaded models" section: set one model as "reference" and another as "target".
4. In the "STL/PLY comparison" section: click "Prepare measurement".
5. Activate "Mouse measurement (pins)" — distances are now shown when hovering over the target model.
6. Click on the model to place measurement points (pins).
7. Optional: activate "Show heatmap" for an area-wide deviation display.
8. Optional: use the section measurement for exact 2D cut measurements.

**Keyboard shortcuts**

- **ESC** — deactivate mouse measurement and cutting-plane drawing
- **Mouse wheel** — zoom
- **Left mouse button + drag** — rotate the model
- **Right mouse button + drag** — pan the model

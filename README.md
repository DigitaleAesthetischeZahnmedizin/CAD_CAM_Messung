# 🦷 CAD_CAM – 3D Tooth Visualization

**English** | [Deutsch](README.de.md)

Browser-based tool for **visualizing and measuring 3D tooth models** (STL/PLY).
The application runs directly in the browser via GitHub Pages — no installation required.

**Live application:** https://digitaleaesthetischezahnmedizin.github.io/CAD_CAM_Messung/

---

## Purpose

The program provides **objective visualization and measurement** of changes to teeth based on
digital 3D scans from different treatment phases (e.g. before and after a preparation, as well as
with restorations in place).

It is used in the context of an **independent procedure for the taking of evidence**
("selbständiges Beweisverfahren", §§ 485 et seq. of the German Code of Civil Procedure, ZPO)
concerning an **alleged / disputed** veneer treatment fault at a dentist in Heilbronn. One of the
disputed points is whether the restorations are to be classified as veneers or as partial crowns.
The application serves solely to illustrate the technical aspects of the matter in dispute.

> **Note:** This is party documentation for illustration purposes only. The final professional and
> legal assessment rests solely with the court-appointed expert and the court. This presentation
> does **not** constitute any final or binding determination of a treatment error.

## Features

- **Load models** – STL/PLY via web link or local file; optional texture (JPG) for PLY models.
- **Display settings** – scale, FOV, background color, grid, camera position (X/Y/Z).
- **Deviation heatmap** – signed color scale (±4 mm) comparing a reference and a target model.
- **Tolerance bands** – adjustable green range, yellow/red and light-blue/dark-blue ranges, maximum threshold.
- **Mouse measurement (pins)** – point-to-surface distances with adjustable point size.
- **Iterative high-precision measurement** ("Sun/Fan") – rays per step, iterations, line-of-sight check to skip gaps.
- **2D cross-section measurement** – clipping plane for precise edge measurement.
- Multilingual interface and light/dark mode.
